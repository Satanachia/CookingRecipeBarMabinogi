## Introdution

Maybe you use some **hand tool** or **trick** so you can make recipes with the correct percentages of the ingredients. With this program written in Java you will be able to get rid of these tools and use a **pop-up bar** with percentage marks.

## How To Use

Is very simple!

You can just do download of the .java programa or download the all code __(if you know how to use it)__.
When you open it y'll have the interface of image 1.

#### Options:
1. Is the bar you must choose the type of recipe.
2. Is when you choose the recipe.
3. This part is not complete, here you will select the game's resolution in the future.
4. **Select Button** - When you select your recipe, just click on the *select button* that will open a pop-up bar for you to center on the game bar(see the image 2). 
5. **Cancel Button** - Just close the program.

## COMMENTS

- This program DOESN'T contain all the game's recipes because it's very boring to create the images, but for that I created another program that automatically generates the images from the percentages. However there may be some bugs.
- My English is terrible, but I hope the text is easy to understand.
