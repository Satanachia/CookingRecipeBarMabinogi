This program in java is useful for cooking bar of recipes.

## Introdution

Maybe you use some **hand tool** or **trick** so you can make recipes with the correct percentages of the ingredients. With this program written in Java you will be able to get rid of these tools and use a **pop-up bar** with percentage marks.

## How To Use

Is very simple!

You can just do download of the .java programa or download the all code __(if you know how to use it)__.

4. **Select Button** - When you select your recipe, just click on the *select button* that will open a pop-up bar for you to center on the game bar(see the image 2). 
5. **Cancel Button** - Just close the program.

## COMMENTS

- This program DOESN'T contain all the game's recipes because it's very boring to create the images, but for that I created another program that automatically generates the images from the percentages. However there may be some bugs.
- My English is terrible, but I hope the text is easy to understand.
