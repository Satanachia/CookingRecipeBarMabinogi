## Introdution

Maybe you use some **hand tool** or **trick** so you can make recipes with the correct percentages of the ingredients. With this program written in Java you will be able to get rid of these tools and use a **pop-up bar** with percentage marks.

## COMMENTS

- This program DOESN'T contain all the game's recipes because it's very boring copy infos.
- My English is terrible, but I hope the text is easy to understand.
